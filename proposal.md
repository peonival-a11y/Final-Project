## Description
I want to create a slide scroller game where I have a small character jumping on platforms and getting coins, and maybe add a counter to it 

## Features
- Feature 1
	- Getting the object to move around but also change image/animation when it's moving, and adding a background 
- Feature 2
	- Adding platforms and potentially adding coins with a counter to register the character getting them
- Feature N 
	- Replace any temporary/placeholder images to be polished and hopefully have the character be rendered and able to get the coins properly without issues

## Challenges
- How to properly have an object move with either 'awsd' keys with spacebar or with just arrow keys
- Having the image be a still image that is continuously repeating when it's being moved left or to right
- How to create the coins and have them register when picked up with a counter

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Briefly describe what is the ideal outcome?
  To create a game that can at least be moveable and is interactive that can also be entertaining  

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Briefly describe the bare essential for a good working outcome?
  The useful thing can be learing something new along the way where I can add another feature to the game where it can be even more entertaining

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Have object controls ready
  2. Have an ideal resolution and image in place

- Week 2
  1. Have more platforms in place to show the movement
  2. Add coins with the platforms and a counter to register the coins

- Week N (Final)
  1. Replace any images with a better rendering of them to be polished
  2. Change fonts or other cosmetics to fit with the theme of the game
